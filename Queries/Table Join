Below are three queries with table joins:
-- Calculation of revenue generated for each film category:

SELECT C.name,
       SUM(A.rental_duration * A.rental_rate) AS revenue_per_category
FROM film A
JOIN film_category B on A.film_id = B.film_id
JOIN category C on B.category_id = C.category_id
GROUP BY C.name
ORDER BY revenue_per_category DESC;

-- Top 10 countries by customer numbers:

SELECT D.country,
      COUNT(A.customer_id) AS customer_number
FROM customer A
JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY customer_number DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Top 10 countries by total amount of payment:

SELECT E.country,
       SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount
FROM payment A
JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
GROUP BY E.country
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
LIMIT 10;
