Here are a few sample queries:
-- Checking for duplicates in the film table:

SELECT title,
       release_year,
       COUNT(*)
FROM film
GROUP BY title, release_year
HAVING COUNT(*) >1;

-- Consistency check on the customer table:
       -- Duplicates:

SELECT LOWER(first_name),
       LOWER(last_name),
       address_id,
       COUNT(*)
FROM customer
GROUP BY LOWER(first_name), LOWER(last_name), address_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >1; 

       -- Email format:

SELECT email
FROM customer
WHERE email NOT LIKE '%@%';

-- Film table summary:
       -- Query 1:

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT film_id) AS count_film,
       COUNT (DISTINCT language_id) AS count_lang,
       COUNT(*) AS count_rows,
       AVG(rental_rate) AS avg_rent,
       MIN(rental_rate) AS min_rent,
       MAX(rental_rate) AS max_rent,
       MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY special_features) AS modal_special_features
FROM film;

       -- Query 2:

SELECT rating,
       COUNT (rating) AS count_rating
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY count_rating DESC;
