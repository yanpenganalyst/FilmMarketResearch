Here are two queries with a common table expression; the latter also contains a subquery:
-- Top 10 paying customers:

WITH customer_rank_cte (customer_id, total_amount) AS
	(SELECT customer_id, 
                SUM(amount) total_amount
	FROM payment
	GROUP BY customer_id)
SELECT A.customer_id,
       A.total_amount,
       D.city,
       E.country
FROM customer_rank_cte AS A
JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
ORDER BY A.total_amount DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Country distribution of the top 100 paying customers:

SELECT country,
       COUNT(customer_id) AS top_customer_number
FROM
  (WITH customer_rank_cte (customer_id, total_amount) AS
	(SELECT customer_id,
	 	SUM(amount) AS total_amount
	FROM payment
	GROUP BY customer_id)
  SELECT A.customer_id, A.total_amount, D.city, E.country
  FROM customer_rank_cte A
  JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
  JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
  JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
  JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
  ORDER BY total_amount DESC
  LIMIT 100) AS top_100_customers -- subquery
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY top_customer_number DESC;
