Below is one query with a common table expression and a window function:
-- Total amount paid by each customer and its deviation from the average:

WITH total_amount_customer_cte (customer_id, total_amount) AS
	(SELECT customer_id,
	 SUM(amount) total_amount 
	 FROM payment
	 GROUP BY customer_id)
SELECT customer_id,
	     total_amount,
	     total_amount - AVG(total_amount) OVER () AS deviation
FROM total_amount_customer_cte
ORDER BY customer_id;
